# Web-Application-Development-Assurance-of-Security-against-2-of-OWASP-Vulnerabilities

## üéØ Objective
The goal of this project is to identify vulnerabilities in a developed application through scanning and implement security measures to address them, based on OWASP recommendations.


### üí™ Skills Learned
- Developing an application using the Django framework.
- Gaining familiarity with the Acunetix tool.
- Researching methods to ensure application security and implementing them.
- Applying security measures to address OWASP vulnerabilities, specifically Broken Authentication and Sensitive Data Exposure.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Django Framework: a python framework to create websites.
- Acunetix: a web appliction security testing tool. 
- OWASP Top 10: a standard document that represents the most critical security risks to web applications.

## üìå Steps
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Developing a Stock Management Application
‚ñ∂ This is the homepage of our developed application, designed to serve as the central hub for user navigation.

‚ñ∂ Upon selecting the "List Items" tab, the user is presented with an interface that displays the current list of items.
    
![Rapport_DEHBISiham_MAGATHind pdf-image-003](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa92f9df-aac2-49f9-a81d-d16bc4ee5eea)

‚ñ∂ If a user wishes to delete an item, he can click the "DELETE" located in the last column of the list.

‚ñ∂ The "Add Item" tab provides functionality for users to seamlessly add new items to their inventory or stock.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Scanning the application using Acunetix
‚ñ∂ Specify the target system and customize the scan settings to align with the desired objectives.

‚ñ∂ Access the scan results and get a detailed report summarizing the findings.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing Security Measures

#### Remediating Broken Authentication

‚ñ∂ We introduced essential modules to enforce strong password restrictions, configured in the settings.py file. This ensures adherence to best practices for password strength and security.

‚ñ∂ We installed and configured the django-mfa package to enhance authentication security by requiring multiple verification factors.

#### Addressing Sensitive Data Exposure
  
‚ñ∂ We set DEBUG mode to False in the settings.py file to prevent sensitive debug information from being exposed, and we restricted the allowed hosts to the localhost (127.0.0.1).

‚ñ∂ We also implemented proper exception handling mechanisms to prevent the leakage of exploitable information.

## NOTE
This project was completed by me and a friend who also specializes in cybersecurity. That‚Äôs why I used 'our' instead of 'me.'
